"""
This file is where the fundamental actions to execute and flesh out a service are defined.

Creating a service involves using the models that are generated and creating utilities and functions that 
interact with those models or provide some computational service.  The models are a representatio of the domain
that the service is meant to operat in.

Most of the logic for business is defined in the python files in the service.  To expose service functionality for the AI
to use, you need to make public function in a .py file somewhere in the actions folder.
