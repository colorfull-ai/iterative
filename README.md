# My CLI and Web Utility Application

This application is a powerful CLI (Command Line Interface) and web utility tool, leveraging both Typer and FastAPI to provide a dynamic and user-friendly experience. It allows users to configure the application using a YAML file and dynamically discovers and integrates scripts as commands and endpoints.

## Features

- Dynamic discovery of Python scripts to extend CLI commands and FastAPI endpoints.
- Customizable through a user-provided configuration file.
- Combines the power of Typer for CLI interactions and FastAPI for web server functionalities.

## Installation

To install this utility, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   cd your-repository-directory
   ```

2. Install the package using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. Activate the Poetry virtual environment:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

## Configuration

Place your `user_config.yaml` in the application's directory or specify its path when starting the application. The configuration file allows you to customize various aspects of the application.

Example of `user_config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration
logging:
  date_format: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
  # ... other configurations ...
```

## Usage

To use the application, you can start the CLI or the web server:

### Starting the Application

```python
from iterative import start_app

start_app()
```

This command initializes the application and discovers available scripts.

### CLI Commands

- `scripts`: Access dynamically discovered scripts.
- `start-util-server`: Starts the utility server on a specified port.

```bash
my_end_user_of_library_test_script.py start-util-server --port 5279
```

### Using the Web Server

The web server provides endpoints dynamically generated from discovered scripts. Access these endpoints at:

```
http://localhost:5279/<endpoint>
```

The package `iterative` leverages `nosql_yorm` for model persistence in databases, particularly when working with Firebase. Here's an explanation of how `iterative` integrates `nosql_yorm` and the benefits this brings to the users of the `iterative` package:

### Integration of `nosql_yorm` in `iterative`

The `iterative` package uses `nosql_yorm` to enhance its interactions with Firebase databases. This integration allows for efficient and straightforward database operations, which are crucial for applications that manage data persistently. 

### Key Benefits of Using `nosql_yorm` in `iterative`

1. **Simplified Database Operations**: `nosql_yorm` abstracts the complexity of Firebase operations, making it easier to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within the `iterative` package.

2. **Model-Driven Approach**: `nosql_yorm` enables a model-driven approach to interact with Firebase. Users of `iterative` can define models that directly map to Firebase collections, streamlining data handling.

3. **Efficient Testing**: With `nosql_yorm`'s integrated caching mechanism, `iterative` can conduct tests without polluting the actual database, leading to faster and cleaner testing cycles.

4. **TypeScript Support**: For users working with TypeScript, `nosql_yorm`'s support for TypeScript client methods can significantly enhance the development experience, especially for applications that utilize both Python and TypeScript.

### Usage Examples in `iterative`

#### Defining Models

Within `iterative`, models are defined by extending `BaseFirebaseModel` from `nosql_yorm`, providing a direct link to Firebase collections.

```python
from nosql_yorm.models import BaseFirebaseModel

class User(BaseFirebaseModel):
    collection_name = "users"
    # Define user-related fields here
```

#### Performing CRUD Operations

Users of `iterative` can directly use the models to perform database operations:

```python
user = User(name="Alice", email="alice@example.com")
user.save()  # Create a new user

fetched_user = User.get_by_id(user.id)  # Read the user data

fetched_user.name = "Alice Smith"
fetched_user.save()  # Update user details

fetched_user.delete()  # Delete the user
```

#### Leveraging Caching for Testing

Tests in `iterative` can utilize the caching feature of `nosql_yorm` for faster and isolated testing:

```python
from nosql_yorm.config import set_library_config

set_library_config(read_write_to_cache=True)

# Testing operations here
```

### Conclusion

The integration of `nosql_yorm` within the `iterative` package provides a powerful, efficient, and developer-friendly way to interact with Firebase databases. It simplifies data management, enhances the testing process, and aligns well with modern development practices involving Firebase and NoSQL databases.
